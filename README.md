## Status

### 1.0

The software is finished -- and by finished, we mean there are no show-stopping, little-children-killing bugs in it. That we know of. There are probably numerous lower-priority bugs triaged into the next point release or service pack, as well.

Here is a more detailed [roadmap](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/wiki/Roadmap).

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.git` and checkout the `main` branch.

### Command line

- Install the latest version of the .NET SDK from this page <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download>
- Next, navigate to `D:\OrchardCore\src\OrchardCore.Cms.Web` or wherever your folder is on the commandline in Administrator mode.
- Call `dotnet run -f net5.0` (or `dotnet run -f netcoreapp3.1` depending on your version of .NET SDK).
- Then open the `http://localhost:5000` URL in your browser.

### Visual Studio

- Download Visual Studio 2019 (any edition) from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
- Open `OrchardCore.sln` and wait for Visual Studio to restore all Nuget packages
- Ensure `OrchardCore.Cms.Web` is the startup project and run it

### Docker

- Run `docker run --name orchardcms -p 8080:80 orchardproject/orchardcore-cms-linux:latest`

Docker images and parameters can be found at <https://hub.docker.com/u/orchardproject/>
