# Orchard Core 1.9.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Media Indexing

Previously, `.PDF` file where auto indexed in the search providers (Elasticsearch, Lucene or Azure AI Search). Now, if you want to continue to index `.PDF` file you'll need to enable `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Pdf` feature.

Additionally, if you needed to enable indexing for text file with `.txt`, `.md` extensions, you'll needed `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Text` feature.

If you needed to enable indexing for other extensions like (`.docx`, or `.pptx`), you'll needed `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.OpenXML` feature.

### Data Access

Previously, the `yessql.db` file was used as a default SQLite database for newly created tenants. Now `OrchardCore.db` is used instead, but you can configure the database name using `SqliteOptions.Database`.

!!! warning
    For backward compatibility, you should use `yessql.db` as the database name in the `OrchardCore_Data_Sqlite` configuration. For more info read the [Data (`OrchardCore.Data`) documentation](../reference/core/Data/README.md).

### SMS Module

In the past, we utilized the injection of `ISmsProvider`for sending SMS messages. However, in this release, it is now necessary to inject `ISmsService` instead.

Additionally, `Twilio` provider is no longer enabled by default. If you want to use Twilio SMS provider, you must enable `OrchardCore.Sms.Twilio` feature.
