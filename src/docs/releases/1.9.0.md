# Orchard Core 1.9.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Drop `Newtonsoft.Json` Support

The utilization of [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json) has been discontinued in both **YesSql** and **OrchardCore**. Instead, we have transitioned to utilize `System.Text.Json` due to its enhanced performance capabilities. To ensure compatibility with `System.Text.Json` during the serialization or deserialization of objects, the following steps need to be undertaken:

 - If your custom `Document` includes a collection with a getter-only property, it is imperative to incorporate a setter or utilize the `init` modifier to facilitate the assignment of values by `System.Text.Json`. For instance:

```csharp
public class MediaProfilesDocument : Document
{
    public Dictionary<string, MediaProfile> MediaProfiles { get; } = new(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
}
```

Should be changed to the following instead:

```csharp
public class MediaProfilesDocument : Document
{
    public Dictionary<string, MediaProfile> MediaProfiles { get; init; } = new(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
}
```

  - If you are using a custom deployment steps, change how you register it by using the new `AddDeployment<>` extension. This extension adds a new service that is required for proper serialization. For instance, instead of registering your deployment step like this:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IDeploymentSource, AdminMenuDeploymentSource>();
services.AddSingleton<IDeploymentStepFactory>(new DeploymentStepFactory<AdminMenuDeploymentStep>());
services.AddScoped<IDisplayDriver<DeploymentStep>, AdminMenuDeploymentStepDriver>();
```

change it to the following:

```csharp
services.AddDeployment<AdminMenuDeploymentSource, AdminMenuDeploymentStep, AdminMenuDeploymentStepDriver>();
```

  - If you are using a custom AdminMenu node, change how you register it by using the new `AddAdminMenu<>` extension. This extension adds a new service that is required for proper serialization. For instance, instead of registering your custom admin menu nodep like this:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IAdminNodeProviderFactory>(new AdminNodeProviderFactory<PlaceholderAdminNode>());
services.AddScoped<IAdminNodeNavigationBuilder, PlaceholderAdminNodeNavigationBuilder>();
services.AddScoped<IDisplayDriver<MenuItem>, PlaceholderAdminNodeDriver>();
```

change it to the following:

```csharp
services.AddAdminMenu<PlaceholderAdminNode, PlaceholderAdminNodeNavigationBuilder, PlaceholderAdminNodeDriver>();
```

  - Any serializable object that contains a polymorphic property (a base type that can contain sub-classes instances) needs to register all possible sub-classes this way:

```csharp
services.AddJsonDerivedTypeInfo<UrlCondition, Condition>();
```

In particular, any type introduced in custom modules inheriting from `MenuItem`, `AdminNode`, `Condition`, `ConditionOperator`, `Query`, `SitemapType` will have to use this method.

### Media Indexing

Previously, `.pdf` files were automatically indexed in the search providers (Elasticsearch, Lucene or Azure AI Search). Now, if you want to continue to index `.PDF` file you'll need to enable the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Pdf` feature.

Additionally, if you need to enable indexing for text file with `.txt`, `.md` extensions, you will need the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Text` feature.

If you need to enable indexing for other extensions like (`.docx`, or `.pptx`), you will need the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.OpenXML` feature.

### SMS Module

In the past, we utilized the injection of `ISmsProvider` for sending SMS messages. However, in this release, it is now necessary to inject `ISmsService` instead.

Additionally, `Twilio` provider is no longer enabled by default. If you want to use Twilio SMS provider, you must enable the `OrchardCore.Sms.Twilio` feature.

## Change Logs

### Azure AI Search Module

Introducing a new "Azure AI Search" module, designed to empower you in the administration of Azure AI Search indices. When enabled with the "Search" module, it facilitates frontend full-text search capabilities through Azure AI Search. For more info read the [Azure AI Search](../reference/modules/AzureAISearch/README.md) docs.

### Deployment Module

Added new extensions to make registering custom deployment step easier:

- `services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep>()`.
- `services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep, TDisplayDriver>()`.
- `services.AddDeploymentWithoutSource<TStep, TDisplayDriver>()`.

### Workflow Module

 The method `Task TriggerEventAsync(string name, IDictionary<string, object> input = null, string correlationId = null, bool isExclusive = false, bool isAlwaysCorrelated = false)` 
 was changed to return `Task<IEnumerable<WorkflowExecutionContext>>` instead.

### GraphQL Module

When identifying content types for GraphQL exposure, we identify those without a stereotype to provide you with control over the behavior of stereotyped content types. A new option, `DiscoverableSterotypes`, has been introduced in `GraphQLContentOptions`. This allows you to specify stereotypes that should be discoverable by default.

For instance, if you have several content types stereotyped as `ExampleStereotype`, you can make them discoverable by incorporating the following code into the startup class:

```csharp
services.Configure<GraphQLContentOptions>(options =>
{
    options.DiscoverableSterotypes.Add("ExampleStereotype");
});
```

### Admin

The admin menu has undergone performance enhancements, and new helpers have been added. When incorporating `INavigationProvider` in your project, you can now utilize `NavigationHelper.IsAdminMenu(name)` instead of the previous approach using `string.Equals(name, "admin", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)`. Moreover, when passing route values to an action, it is advised to store them in a constant variable. An illustrative example is provided below.

```csharp
public class AdminMenu : INavigationProvider
{
    private static readonly RouteValueDictionary _routeValues = new()
    {
        { "area", "OrchardCore.Settings" },
        { "groupId", AdminSiteSettingsDisplayDriver.GroupId },
    };

    protected readonly IStringLocalizer S;

    public AdminMenu(IStringLocalizer<AdminMenu> stringLocalizer)
    {
        S = stringLocalizer;
    }

    public Task BuildNavigationAsync(string name, NavigationBuilder builder)
    {
        if (!NavigationHelper.IsAdminMenu(name))
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        builder
            .Add(S["Configuration"], configuration => configuration
                .Add(S["Settings"], settings => settings
                    .Add(S["Admin"], S["Admin"].PrefixPosition(), admin => admin
                        .AddClass("admin")
                        .Id("admin")
                        .Action("Index", "Admin", _routeValues)
                        .Permission(PermissionsAdminSettings.ManageAdminSettings)
                        .LocalNav()
                    )
                )
            );

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
